 If a success block is specified, it is the responsibility of the block to set the image of the image view before returning. If no success block is specified, the default behavior of setting the image with `self.image = image` is applied.

 @param identifier          The downloaded image will be cached by this identifier. The cache is managed by YLImageCache.
 @param cancelExistedTask   YES if you want to cancel the existed task, otherwise, pass NO.
 @param success             A block to be executed when the image data task finishes successfully. 
                            This block has no return value and takes three arguments: the request sent from the client, the response received from the server, and the image created from the response data of request. If the image was returned from cache, the response parameter will be `nil`.
 @param failure             A block object to be executed when the image data task finishes unsuccessfully, or that finishes successfully. 
                            This block has no return value and takes three arguments: the request sent from the client, the response received from the server, and the error object describing the network or parsing error that occurred.
